#' Simple Example Spectrum
#'
#' A subset of an example spectrum depicting turnover from a protein substrate
#' (at 1530.8 m/z) to product (at 1516.8 m/z).  While the original spectrum
#' contained nearly 2 million measurements, this spectrum has been trimmed to
#' lie between 1300 m/z and 1600 m/z, with approximately 46000 measurements
#' included.
